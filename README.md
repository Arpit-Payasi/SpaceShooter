# About project
Mini-game written in the C ++ programming language using the SFML graphics library. 
The essence of the game: the player - a spaceship, must shoot at the falling enemies - figures in order to earn points and not lose health points. When enemies are defeated, health points are taken away from them, from which their color becomes more transparent. When the enemy runs out of health points, he disappears from the screen. When the player and the enemy collide, the player's health points are taken away. The larger the enemy, the more speed, damage and health he has.
